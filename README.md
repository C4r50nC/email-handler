# Email Handler

A browser extension that automatically replies emails based on received content.

## How To Use

1. Pre-define the following:

   - A set of keywords
   - Content in the reply for the set of keywords
   - Recipients (To, CC, and BCC fields)

2. When new emails are received, navigate into the details page, and the email handler will automatically set up the reply content and the recipients based on detected keywords.

3. After checking the content, click **Send** button to send the email.
